# TODO service with Layered Architecture

This structure represents a layered architecture style, which is a design pattern that organizes code into separate layers, each with a specific responsibility. In this structure, we can identify the following layers:

## Presentation Layer: components/ and page.tsx

This layer is responsible for displaying the information to the user and handling user interactions. The components folder contains the UI components (e.g., `ConfirmationModal.tsx`, `ErrorBoundary.tsx`, `TodoForm.tsx`, `TodoItem.tsx`, and `TodoList.tsx`). The `page.tsx` file serves as the application's entry point, where the components, contexts, and other parts of the application are combined and rendered.

## Business Layer: contexts/ and models/

This layer contains the application's core logic and manages the data flow between the presentation layer and the persistence layer. The contexts/ folder, specifically the `TodoContext.tsx` file, represents the business layer by providing a centralized state management system for the application. The models/ folder contains the `Todo.ts` file, which represents the Todo data model that is used throughout the application.

## Persistence Layer: service/

This layer is responsible for communicating with external systems or data storage to fetch, store, and update data. The services folder, containing the `TodoService.ts` file, represents the persistence layer, as it contains the functions for interacting with the API. 


In summary, this structure separates the concerns of presentation, business logic, and data persistence, following the principles of a layered architecture style.
